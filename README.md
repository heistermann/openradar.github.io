openradar.github.io
===================

Preliminary repository to host the openradar VM website content.

If you want to build the html content yourself, clone the repository
https://github.com/openradar/oss_weather_radar_vm. Then navigate to 
the `doc` directory and call `make html`. html content will be written to
`doc/build`.

To build the html content, you need to install Sphinx (http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html).
